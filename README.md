# Life-in-Dots

In this web app, made with react, the user enters his or her date of birth and can visualize how much of his or her life has passed compared with a life expectancy of 90 years. Specifically, visualization is via a grid in three modes:

    • weeks: each row of the grid shows 52 squares (1 year)
    • months: each row shows 36 squares (3 years)
    • years: each row shows 10 squares (1 decade)

You can display the deaths of some famous people in the grid to see whether you lived longer or shorter.
